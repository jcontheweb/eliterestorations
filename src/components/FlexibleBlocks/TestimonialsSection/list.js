        review: 'I was a property manager in the area for 5 years. I used Elite Carpet Care the entire time I was there. They are very reasonable and always do a great job. The owner Spencer was always great to work with and was very accommodating if I had any issues. They have helped me out in emergency situations with floods and carpet repair and have even done a great job cleaning my own carpets at home. All of the people that work for the company have been great, especially Tyler, he does an excellent job and is great to work with. I highly recommend them whether it is for professional or personal business. I will greatly miss working with them now that I am no longer in the area ðŸ˜ž',

        review: 'Our church experienced a broken fire sprinkler line last week in the midst of the below freezing temperatures and I called Elite for information on how to treat and a quote.  Over the phone, they were very helpful as to what needed to be done and were able to provide services in a very timely manner, especially considering how busy they were with so many similar situations. Upon arriving at church, they were very friendly explaining what they would be doing. Their work was very efficient and thorough. We have been very pleased with the work they did in cleaning a large area including hallways and classrooms as well as a few area rugs.  The carpet looks amazing and smells incredible. I would highly recommend this company to others.  We are very grateful for such a thorough cleaning job after such a mess.',

        review: "I have used Elite Carpet Care and Restoration for professional and personal jobs and they have always been absolutely amazing. I recommend them to anyone I can. Previously managing an apartment community with hundreds of move outs at the end of the month and people wanting to move in within 4-5 days the guys at Elite would come and clean multiple apartments a day for us and turn around the next day to come back and do it again. I have personally used them to clean the carpets in my home and will continue to use them for all of my carpet cleaning needs. I have never been unsatisfied when they leave. Very professional & friendly.",
