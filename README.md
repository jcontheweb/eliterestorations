# Advanced Gatsby Wordpress ACF Starter

This is a bare-bones repository to help you get started building pages in gatsby in a component-like fashion with Wordpress using the Advanced Custom Field (ACF) plugin's Flexible Content field on multiple post types.

Heavily inspired by Henrik Wirth's [gatsby-starter-wordpress-advanced](https://github.com/henrikwirth/gatsby-starter-wordpress-advanced/tree/tutorial/part-7)
